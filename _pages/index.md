I am a Ph.D. student at Kyushu University, Joint Graduate School of Mathematics for Innovation.  
Currently I am working at Control & Optimization Labolatory, advised by Prof. Kaoru Yamamoto.  

My research interests include control theory, especially, the control of networked systems, such as multi-agent systems and distributed systems.
