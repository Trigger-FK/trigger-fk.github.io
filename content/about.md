I am a Ph.D. student at Kyushu University, Joint Graduate School of Mathematics for Innovation.
Currently, I work at the Control & Optimization Laboratory, advised by Prof. Kaoru Yamamoto.

<!-- My research interests lie in control theory, especially in applying control-theoretic methods to real-world systems such as robots and quadcopters. In particular, I aim to evaluate to what extent control performance can be improved by applying theoretical methods in practical environments, and to explore how control performance can be further enhanced under real-world conditions. -->
